### Python Version
2.7.10

### Installation
```sh
$ pip install pytrie bitarray
```  

### Running
First change your directory to the database you're assigning to that machine (db2 or db3). Don't worry about db1, that will be initiated in the GUI.
```sh
$ cd /path/to/EC504-Final-Project/db_
$ export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/EC504-Final-Project
```  
Then simply run:
```sh
$ python db_.py
```
